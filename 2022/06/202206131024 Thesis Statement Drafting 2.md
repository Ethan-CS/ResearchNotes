### Questions & thoughts:

(Second attempt)

**Agency:**

In stochastic models of infectious disease, agency characteristics represent individual awareness of infection risk and their intention to engage in risk-associated behaviour.Such characteristics can model how likely an individual is to either mitigate risk when engaging in risk-associated behaviours or seek relevant testing and treatment post-infection.

In stochastic models with agency characteristics, the performance of specialised external interventions in controlling the spread of infection through a population of agents can be studied. Novel strategies such as max-weight clique algorithms will perform better than stochastic translations of previously successful deterministic strategies in such stochastic, agency-related formulations of infection models.


**Dynamical:**

Exact dynamical compartmental graph models of disease (without graph decomposition arguments) computationally out-perform stochastic compartmental graph models of disease only for small graphs and limited larger graphs when a large range of initial conditions are to be considered. 

In general, the number of equations required for an exact and deterministic description of a compartmental graph model is exponential in the number of vertices. The number of equations required for an exact description of a compartmental model on a graph with polynomially many connected subgraphs is polynomial in the number of vertices.

The dynamical approach to modelling disease exhibits acceptable computational performance on larger graphs with certain structural properties. In particular, the approach exhibits acceptable performance on graphs with single cut-vertex cut-sets, such as paths, caterpillars, trees and ER graphs with restricted density when the closure result from (Kiss) is implemented because the numbers of equations required with this result is polynomial in the number of vertices for each of these graph classes.

The result in Kiss (cite) can be extended and generalised to larger clique cut-sets so that the dynamical approach exhibits acceptable performance on larger graphs with cut-vertex sets.
