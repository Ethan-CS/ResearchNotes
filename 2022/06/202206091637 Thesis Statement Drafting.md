### Questions & thoughts:

(First draft)

Features of agency introduced to existing models of disease yields more contextual results, relevant to informing those tasked with slowing the spread of infections in particular populations.

For example, in understanding the spread of sexually transmitted infections, agency characteristics can be used to model many susceptible individuals in a population being aware of the risk of infection or contraction and this having some degree of impact on their intention to engage in risk-associated behaviour. Further, agency characteristics determine how likely an individual is to either mitigate risk when engaging in risk-associated behaviours or to seek relevant testing and treatment post-event. 

After the introduction of contextual agency-based characteristics, the performance of specialised external interventions in stemming the spread of infection through a population of agents can be studied. Novel strategies such as max-weight clique algorithms will perform better in such stochastic, agency-related formulations of infection models than stochastic translations of previously successful deterministic strategies.

Dynamical compartmental models on graphs are computationally feasible on small graphs and some larger graphs with cut-sets of vertices. These models are particularly advantageous when a scenario requires modelling results for a large range of initial conditions, since a system of equations can be iteratively solved in time polynomial in the number of equations.
