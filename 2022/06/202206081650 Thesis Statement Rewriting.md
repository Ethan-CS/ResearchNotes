# Thesis Statement Rewriting

-----

### Questions & thoughts:

My previous attempt at a thesis statement was very poor and did not fit the purpose or requirements. I need to try again, as this has been mentioned at both progression reports.

I'm going to start with a list of things I'd like to have statements regarding and go from there.

**Consider:**

Things I could/should have statements about:
- Agency in (simulation-based and formal) models of disease
	- How do we believe this 'improves' these models?
	- Any trade-offs, e.g. complexity?
- Formal modelling (dynamical approach)
	- Vanilla: feasible for (such and such) graphs
	- Cut-vertex sets: feasible for (some more) graphs
	- Path/tree decomposition: feasible for (yet more) graphs
	- Complexity trade-offs from using these decompositions? Still worth it?
	- Why bother with this approach in the first place?
