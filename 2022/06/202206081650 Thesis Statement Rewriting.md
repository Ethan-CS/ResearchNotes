# Thesis Statement Rewriting

-----

### Questions & thoughts:

My previous attempt at a thesis statement was very poor and did not fit the purpose or requirements. I need to try again, as this has been mentioned at both progression reports.

I'm going to start with a list of things I'd like to have statements regarding and go from there.

What do we want to show?
- Features of agency can be introduced to existing models to achieve contextualised results.
	- E.g. STIs - modelling with agency allows us to account for individuals often having awareness of risk of infection, carry on anyway; vary how many not aware; vary likelihoods if aware -> {avoid risk-associated behaviour, seek treatment post-infection}
- Modelling agency allows us to model interaction of external intervention and spread of infection through a population of agents
	- E.g. FIREFIGHTER with agency characteristics - can use intervention each turn to increase agency-characteristic of a proportion of the population, e.g. modelling direct community intervention. 
- Dynamical graph models of disease are computationally advantageous (compared to simulation) for relatively small graphs, particularly when a large set of modelling conditions are required to be evaluated.
	- Because generating the system of equations is the 'hard work,' inputting initial conditions and solving can be done in poly time (if you choose an appropriate solver) whereas we'd have to run a large number of simulations for each set of initial conditions otherwise.

**Consider:**

Things I could have statements about:
- Agency in (simulation-based and formal) models of disease
	- How do we believe this 'improves' these models?
	- Any trade-offs, e.g. complexity?
	- Conclusions about defence strategies when protection is involved
- Formal modelling (dynamical approach)
	- Feasibility:
		- Vanilla: feasible for (such and such) graphs
		- Cut-vertex sets: feasible for (some more) graphs
		- Path/tree decomposition: feasible for (yet more) graphs
	- Complexity trade-offs from using decompositions? Still worth it?
	- Why bother with this approach in the first place?
