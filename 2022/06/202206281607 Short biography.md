### Writing

Publisher for GTA Pedagogies got in touch and asked for full names, short bios and whether we want hard-copies of the journal. Very tight turn-around, 24hrs, so I've pulled something together pretty quickly. Hopefully this is enough, the bio is only 100 words (max) so not too serious hopefully.

1. Full name: Ethan Thomas Hunter (this has changed since we wrote the paper!), University of Glasgow
2. Ethan is a PhD student working in the intersection between Computing Science, Maths and Biology. His current work focuses on exact representations of models of infectious disease, using systems of differential equations solvable for any set of initial conditions. He is interested in introducing features of agency into these models and understanding how this changes strategies to control disease spread. He has taught a variety of courses as a GTA and finds this work very rewarding.
3. Would love a hard-copy, please and thank you - can pick up from the department (and help distribute) when they arrive.
