# Pre-processing graphs for equation generation

### Questions & thoughts:

I'm having a hard time understanding where path decomposition may fit into processing input for equation generation (and, in particular, which graph classes it would help to use this on) so I'm taking a step back and first understanding cut-vertices. Then, cut-sets (specifically clique cut-sets). Then, I should be in a better position to re-attempt understanding how path (and then tree) decomposition might help us expand the size of feasible input for equation generation.

**Consider:**

Go back to Kiss et al. paper to understand cut-vertex approach before attempting to understand clique cut-sets.
