### Questions & thoughts:

1. **When is the equation generation procedure 'better' than typical simulation approaches to modelling compartmental models on networks?**
	1. What do we mean by better? At least as fast to achieve same level of accuracy?
	2. What are the typical simulation approaches? Monte Carlo - specifics?
2. **For which graphs is the equation generation approach to modelling compartmental models on networks 'feasible'?**
	1. How do we determine/define feasible?
	2. How specific can we be about which graphs, e.g. can we make some analytic statements for certain graph classes and provide experimental/statistical results for others (such as random graph classes)?
3. **Can we incorporate the 'good parts' of our equation generation procedure with more tractable approaches (such as MC simulation) to come up with a more tractable hybrid approach?**
	1. Define 'good parts'
	2. Which other approaches are good candidates?
	3. What would a hybrid approach look like, and would this be more useful in any sense than the individual approaches drawn from to create the approach?
