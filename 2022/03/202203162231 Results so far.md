### Questions & thoughts:

Managed to begin experimenting with ER graphs - these plots shows box plots representing 50 experiments for each probability value from 0.01 to 0.2 in increments of 0.01 on ER graphs on 15 vertices (one plot with all results as scatter points overlaid, other just box and whisker plots).

**Consider:** how should/could we extend this to other (random) graph classes? How can we achieve formal results, not just plots - stats stuff?
