### Questions & thoughts:

Option for web dev with Java [Spring](https://spring.io/web-applications)
> Spring makes building web applications fast and hassle-free. By removing much of the boilerplate code and configuration associated with web development, you get a modern web programming model that streamlines the development of server-side HTML applications, REST APIs, and bidirectional, event-based systems." (from linked website 16/07/22)

I like the sound of this option, as it allows for a great deal of adaptability with requests and server capacity. Basically, it will ensure the web app is easily scalable.
