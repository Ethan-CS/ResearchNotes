# Firefighter on $P_k$-free graphs

**Previous note:** [[202310231502 FF Optimal strategy number of defences]]

### Questions & thoughts:

Original theorem:[^1] Firefighter can be solved in time $O(n^{k-2}(n+m))=O(n^k)$ on $P_k$-free graphs.

Original proof: 
 - Let $(G, r)$ be an instance of Firefighter such that $G$ is $P_k$-free i.e., the longest induced path in $G$ has at most $k-1$ vertices
