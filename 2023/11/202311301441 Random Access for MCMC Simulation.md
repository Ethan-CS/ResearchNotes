# Random Access fro MCMC Simulation

**Previous note:** [[202311291140 FF and STD Network Models]]

### Questions & thoughts:

  
From another talk at Epidemics - look at how random numbers are generated in ODE code, is this causing strange effects in other  models, particularly those including vaccination? Could use 'random access' approach.
