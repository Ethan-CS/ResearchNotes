# Nice way to paper-ise work on FF?

**Previous note:** [[]]

-----

### Questions & thoughts:

Could I implement FF and variants currently working on and give some graphs/results of actual models of disease, showing different starting parameters, different interventions and even compare to real-world data?

Many people working on FF justify by saying this is a (rudimentary) model of disease. I could show: how close FF gets to results, how close variants get, quantify how much closer to actual data variants get and justify their use as also NP-hard but tractable in some nice cases (path containable, etc).
