# Firefighter Motivation Rewrite

### Questions & thoughts:

 Due to climate change and land use alteration, wildfires are surging globally. Recent UN models predict continual rises in the frequency and intensity of wildfires as we struggle for survival through the 21st century: an increase of up to 14 per cent by 2030, 30 per cent by the end of 2050 and 50 per cent by 2100. Our work models the deployment of firefighting resources, where rigorous analysis and actionable insights can make all the difference in preserving our planet's irreplaceable natural landscapes and protecting animal and human life.

Our modern world and recent history present immediate threats not only to the planet's natural resources but to the lives that created such conditions. The modern interconnected and urbanised world has increased both the potential for diseases to spread and the risk of these diseases escalating into epidemics or pandemics [cite](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9175207/#:~:text=The%20major%20factors%20contributing%20to,transitioning%20to%20being%20more%20urban). The same models we use to understand fighting wildfires are just as applicable to the spread of disease in human and animal populations, joining efforts to inform control and intervention measures to minimise risk in these scenarios.

Our research delves into the heart of the Firefighter problem and variants tailored to model these and other scenarios, exploring strategies that help optimise resources and minimise damage across a range of applications in our world today. As we engage with these problems, envision a world where forests endure as inevitable damage to natural habitats is minimised and increasingly likely pandemics are stifled under dynamic intervention strategies.
