### Questions & thoughts:

In my third APR, as with previous two, I was given advice to improve my writing style. The examiners were once again complimentary of my technical writing, but expressed that I do not provide adequate narrative nor motivation for the technical details and overall picture. Ciaran provided me with a book by Steven Pinker called _The Sense of Style,_ which he recommends to PhD students often as this gives an edge when submitting papers, proposals, etc.

To start thinking about improving my sense of narrative and motivation, I will use my current Firefighter problem work. To begin, I would like to find some motivating uses for Firefighter (besides 'it's just an interesting problem').

**Consider:**

(Scenario: forest fire, fire in oil terminal[^2] or fire in high-rise[^3]).

Hundreds of feet above a forest. Smoke rising above the trees, fire becoming visible as it begins to spread. In a spotter plane, coordinating five planes in their deployment of around 1,000 gallons of fire retardant each. Can you contain the fire with these resources, if so what is your strategy? If not, how many refills will be needed and when should they be carried out? Can the fire be contained without the forest being entirely burned?

(Scenario: virus spreading across population[^1]).
