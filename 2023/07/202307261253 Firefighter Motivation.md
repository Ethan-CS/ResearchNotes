### Questions & thoughts:

In my third APR, as with previous two, I was given advice to improve my writing style. The examiners were once again complimentary of my technical writing, but expressed that I do not provide adequate narrative nor motivation for the technical details and overall picture. Ciaran provided me with a book by Steven Pinker called _The Sense of Style,_ which he recommends to PhD students often as this gives an edge when submitting papers, proposals, etc.

To start thinking about improving my sense of narrative and motivation, I will use my current Firefighter problem work. To begin, I would like to find some motivating uses for Firefighter (besides 'it's just an interesting problem').
