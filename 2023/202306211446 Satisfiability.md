### Questions & thoughts:

Proof of Firefighter being NP-Complete on graphs with max degree 3 where fire starts on degree of vertex 3 involves complex proof from 3-SAT variant. I'm going to learn about SAT problems now.

### SAT problems
-----
**SAT**
 - Instance: a boolean formula $b$
 - Question: does there exist an interpretation (a way of assigning TRUE/FALSE to literals of $b$) that satisfies (evaluates to TRUE) $b$?
-----
**3-SAT**
 - Instance: a formula in conjunctive normal form with a set of clauses each containing up to 3 literals.
 - Question: does there exist an interpretation satisfying the formula?
-----
**NAE 3-SAT**
Instance: an ordered pair $(B, C)$ composed of a set of boolean variables $B$ and a set of clauses $C$ over $B$ in CNF each containing exactly 3
