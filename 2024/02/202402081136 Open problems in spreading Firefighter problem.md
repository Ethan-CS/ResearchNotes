# Open problems in spreading Firefighter problem

### Questions & thoughts:

In their conclusion [[202402071349 Spreading Vaccination - related work|(see summary here)]], authors note that they studied vaccination spreading to all undefended and unburned neighbours and non-spreading, but the rate of vaccination spread for any actual modelling application is almost certainly between these two. They suggest studying this as a different problem. 

They also suggest studying a more complex compartmental-type process where individuals can go from incubation to symptomatic (with a small stochastic delay) before contagious for the purpose of spreading infection. Could also consider adding probability of transmission to edges or probabilities on vertices giving their susceptibility.
