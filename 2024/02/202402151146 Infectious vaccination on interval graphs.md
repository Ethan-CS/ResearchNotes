### Questions & thoughts:

**Claim.** Let $(G, r)$ be a rooted interval graph such that $r$ is the left-most vertex in the interval representation of $G$. Under optimal defence, the infectious defence firefighter problem ends after a single time-step.

**Proof.** At time $t=0$, fire breaks out at $r$, the interval with leftmost left endpoint in the interval representation of $G$. In this interval representation, consider the set of intervals $I$ that intersect intervals that neighbour $r$ but do not intersect the interval $r$. At time $t=1$, defend the vertex that corresponds to an interval in $I$ with rightmost right endpoint of intervals in $I$. Then, fire spreads to the neighbours of $r$. Now, defence spreads to vertices corresponding to the other intervals in $I$. Due to the
