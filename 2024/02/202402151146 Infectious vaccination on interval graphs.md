# Infectious vaccination on interval graphs

**Previous note:** [[202402081136 Open problems in spreading Firefighter problem]]

### Questions & thoughts:

**Claim.** Let $(G, r)$ be a rooted interval graph such that $r$ is the left-most vertex in the interval representation of $G$. Under optimal defence, the infectious defence firefighter problem ends after a single time-step.

**Proof.** At time $t=0$, fire breaks out at $r$, the interval with leftmost left endpoint in the interval representation of $G$. In this interval representation, consider the intervals that intersect intervals that neighbour $r$ but do not intersect the interval $r$. Of these, defend the vertex whose interval has the rightmost right endpoint.
