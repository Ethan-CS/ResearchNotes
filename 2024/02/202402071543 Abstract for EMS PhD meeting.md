### Questions & thoughts:

Firefighting with costs and infectious defence

The firefighter problem is a spreading process on a graph (network) in which a 'root' vertex is burning at the first time-step, then for each subsequent time-step we can defend a vertex before each burning vertex spreads the fire to any of its undefended and unburned neighbours. This continues until the fire can no longer spread. Several variants of this have been considered, such as adding weights to each vertex with a goal of maximising the total weight saved or introducing an integer budget to defend a given number of vertices per turn. We explore two variants of the firefighter problem: one in which each vertex has a cost to defend and another variant in which defence can also infect (a certain number of) undefended and unburned neighbours each turn. For each, we explore what adapting the problem in these ways means for strategies and tractability results.
