### Overall Writing

Please avoid using references as grammatical objects ("in [X]"). Instead, either tack them at an appropriate point of the sentence without referring to them (e.g."the problem is known to be NP-hard [X]"), or name the authors ("Y et al. prove that the problem is NP-hard [X]").

I find it much easier to navigate a paper when counters for statements (theorems, lemma, etc) are:  
 + unified (no Theorem 1 and Lemma 1, rather each number is only assigned to a single statement)  
 + separated by section (so the first statement in Section 3 is Theorem/Lemma/... 3.1)  

### Overall Structure

The writing of the paper should be thoroughly revised for readability. In particular the paper should be more structured, with different types of content (motivation, related work, own contributions, techniques) separated into logical sections.

### Abstract

In the abstract, start by presenting the firefighter problem, as it is not clear that the reader knows it. 

Also in the abstract, it is common to separate the results into a different paragraph


### Preliminaries

In page 1-2, the whole paragraph starting with "We first give graph theoretic", as well as the formal definition of the problem (in the box) should be moved to a Preliminaries section. In fact, most things in the paragraph could be omitted, since they are standard graph notation.  

### Related Work

I would like to see a much more expanded section on related work. FF and related problems have a vast collection of works, including minimization and maximization versions, approximation, etc.  

### Contribution

 I recommend including formal theorems in the Contributions section (Sec 1.1)  
 so the reader can immediately see a collection of the results proved in your  
 paper (and can judge, just from the Introduction, if they want to read the  
 technical content).
