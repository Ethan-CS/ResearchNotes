### Questions & thoughts:

SFire is a version of the firefighter problem where defence spreads in the same way as fire. Specifically, on a graph $G$ at time 0 a vertex labelled the root $r$ is 'burning' and all other vertices are 'open,' meaning neither burning nor defended. At each subsequent time step: we choose one vertex in G to be defended, then fire spreads to each of the open neighbours of each burning vertex, then defence spreads to each open neighbour of each defended vertex. We stop when the fire cannot spread. I am writing a decision program for this problem on chordal graphs, for which I leverage the clique tree representation of chordal graphs as subproblems.
