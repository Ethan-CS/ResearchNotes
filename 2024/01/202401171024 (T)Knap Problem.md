### Questions & thoughts:

Another cut from Overleaf left in case it is later needed again.

% Reason for defining Knapsack: we need it to define Temporal Knapsack and show TKnap is NP-hard.
% We need TKnap for a reduction to show CFire with an explicitly temporal cost function on an extended star is NP-hard (easy in vanilla Fire)

We begin with Knapsack (\Knap), a well-known problem in which we have a set of items, each with a value and weight, and wish to know whether we can fit a certain selection of objects into a knapsack of limited weight capacity that meets or exceeds a certain desired value. This problem is famously NP-hard - see \cite{martello_1990} for a survey of results. We therefore reduce from \Knap to a new variant of \Fire to show this variant is NP-hard - technically, we reduce from a temporal variant which we shortly define and show is also NP-hard (and indeed complete).

\begin{problem}
  \name{\textsc{Knapsack} (\Knap)}
  \instance{\begin{itemize}
      \item A set of items $I$, where each $i\in I$ has an associated:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item value $\psi_i\in\mathbb{N}$ and
        \item weight $\omega_i\in\mathbb{N}$, and
      \end{itemize}
      \item integer values $x$, the desired value, and $w$, the weight capacity.
  \end{itemize}}
  \question{Can we select a subset $S\subseteq I$, such that:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item $\sum_{s\in S}\psi_s\geq x$, and
      \item $\sum_{s\in S}\omega_s\leq w$?
  \end{itemize}}
\end{problem}

Given \Knap is fairly famous and widely studied, we state the following result without proof and direct readers unfamiliar with the problem and associated results to \cite{martello_1990} for a comprehensive introduction.

\begin{theorem}\cite{martello_1990}\label{thm:knap-np}
    \Knap is NP-complete.
\end{theorem}

As mentioned, we in fact reduce from a temporal variant of \Knap. In this variant, each item also has a time-step in which it can be selected and we can only select a certain proportion of weights in each time-step. For this problem definition and throughout, note that for a set $A$ and integer $n$ we denote by $A^n$ the set of sets of elements of $A$ of size at most $n$.

\begin{problem}
  \name{\textsc{Temporal Knapsack} (\TKnap)}
  \instance{\begin{itemize}
      \item The lifetime of the problem (maximum time-step) $T$,
      \item A set of items $I$, where each $i\in I$ has an associated:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item value $\psi_i\in\mathbb{N}$,
        \item weight $\omega_i\in\mathbb{N}$ and
        \item times $T\subseteq\mathbb{N}^T$, representing the time-steps in which the item can be selected, and
      \end{itemize}
      \item integer values $x$, the desired value, and $W$, a set of weight capacities for each time-step up to $T$.
  \end{itemize}}
  \question{Can we select a subset $S\subseteq I$, such that:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item each $s\in S$ has at least one time-step less than $T$
      \item $\sum_{s\in S}\psi_s\geq x$, and
      \item for each time-step $t$, the items chosen at time $t$ do not exceed the weight allowance $w_t\in W$?
  \end{itemize}}
\end{problem}

So we can later give a hardness reduction from \TKnap to a new variant of \Fire, we prove it is NP-hard (and, in fact, complete).

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:tknap-np}
    \TKnap is NP-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We prove \TKnap is NP-hard by reduction from \Knap, which is NP-complete by Theorem \ref{thm:knap-np}. Consider an arbitrary instance of \Knap with items $I$, desired value $x$ and weight capacity $w$. Construct an instance of \TKnap: use the same desired value and let $T=1$, let $W=\{w\}$ and let the active time series of each item in the item set $I^\prime$ of the \TKnap instance be the singleton set $\{1\}$. This encodes an arbitrary instance of \Knap as an instance of \TKnap where one is a yes-instance if and only if the other is also a yes-instance.
    
    To show \TKnap is in NP, we consider a certificate of a yes-instance, a satisfying selection $S$ of items whose values sum to at least the desired value, weights sum to at most the weight capacity and times all contain at least one time-step less than $T$. Clearly, this can be done in $O(|S|)$-time, which is at worst $O(|I|)$, using a single for-loop over the items selected, so the problem is NP-complete for polynomially-sized inputs.
\end{proof}
