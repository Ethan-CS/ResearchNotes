Spiel about/introduction to monadic logic, also cut from Overleaf doc.

\subsection{Monadic logic}

Monadic logical systems are fragments of logic that restrict relational systems to monadic inputs i.e., taking single inputs. Monadic first-order logic is so restrictive that it is decidable, but introducing even a single operator of arity greater than one results in an undecidable logic \cite{graedel_2003}. Monadic second-order logic (MSO) is a fragment of second-order logic that restricts second-order quantification to elements (MSO$_1$) or elements and sets (MSO$_2$). In particular, MSO permits: variables for (sets of) vertices and (sets of) edges; the usual logical connectives $\neg, \vee, \wedge, \implies \textrm{ and } \iff$; the universal and existential quantifiers $\forall$ and $\exists$ respectively; and well-formulated predicates. We direct readers unfamiliar with MSO to \cite{courcelle_2012} for a comprehensive and rigorous overview or chapter 7 of \cite{cygan_2015} for a more accessible introduction. 

We use an extension of MSO that permits counting, including calculation of cardinalities, called Counting MSO (CMSO).\footnote{Sometimes referred to as extended MSO (EMSO)} A comprehensive definition with examples is provided in \cite{arnborg_1991}; several authors have shown that the following result, Courcelle's Theorem, holds for problems expressible in CMSO - for example, in \cite{arnborg_1991, klaedtke_2003}. See \cite{langer_2014} for a useful survey of different monadic logical systems.

Expression of a graph problem in MSO implies there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the problem on graphs of bounded treewidth by the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}[Courcelle's Theorem]\label{thm:courcelle}
    \cite{courcelle_1990} If a graph problem can be defined in in MSO, the problem can be solved in $O(n)$ time on graphs of bounded treewidth, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph.
\end{theorem}
