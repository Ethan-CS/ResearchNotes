# Instances of CFire tractable on static costs, hard on temporal

**Previous note:** [[202401161332 CFire on Spider Graphs]]

-----

### Questions & thoughts:

Maybe I'm barking up wrong tree trying to exploit graph structure to construct a class on which CFire with static costs is poly. time solvable but with temporal costs remains hard. Perhaps I should focus on one instance where CFire on static functions is known to be tractable and make a claim about complexity of temporal functions e.g., a function that takes into account the state of the entire graph at every time-step, cannot enumerate all states efficiently as each depends on choice of strategy. HOWEVER, this would mean there are IMPLICIT as well as EXPLICIT temporal cost functions, so would need to be careful about wording.
