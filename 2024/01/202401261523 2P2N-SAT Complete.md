### Questions & thoughts:

From [link](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/16817/is-the-kpkn-3sat-problem-np-complete):

2P2N-3SAT is NP-complete

Take a 2P1N-SAT instance, known to be NP-hard,[^1] check the all-1 vector is not a model, then add the clause with all variables negated to the formula to transform it into a 2P2N-SAT instance. 

For each 1-clause (𝑎) in the new 2P2N formula, replace it by the three following 3-clauses : (𝑎∨𝑥∨𝑥)(¬𝑥∨𝑦∨𝑦)(¬𝑥∨¬𝑦∨¬𝑦) where 𝑥,𝑦 are fresh 2P2N variables (i.e. appearing twice as positive literals and twice as negative literals).  
For each 2-clause (𝑎∨𝑏) in the formula, replace it by the six following 3-clauses : (𝑎∨𝑏∨𝑥)(¬𝑥∨𝑦∨𝑦)(¬𝑥∨¬𝑦∨¬𝑦)(𝑥∨𝑧∨¬𝑧)(𝑧∨𝑡∨¬𝑡)(¬𝑧∨𝑡∨¬𝑡) where 𝑥,𝑦,𝑧,𝑡 are fresh 2P2N variables.  
Keep all 3-clauses in the formula.  
For each 𝑘-clause (𝑘>3) in the formula, transform it into a set of 3-clauses by the usual way, which does not change the number of occurences of positive (negative) literals of the taken 𝑘-clause, but add only extra variables which appear once as a positive literal and once as a negative literal. For each such new variable 𝑥, add the two following clauses to the 3-CNF formula :  (𝑥∨𝑦∨¬𝑦) and  (¬𝑥∨ 𝑦∨¬𝑦) where 𝑦 is a fresh 2P2N variable. 

All these transformations can obviously be done in polynomial time and transform the 2P1N-SAT instance into a 2P2N-3SAT instance. The NP-complete 2P1N-SAT problem is then reducible to the 2P2N-3SAT problem.

The extension to 𝑘P𝑘N-3SAT can be done in the same spirit (a bit longer) to prove it is NP-complete as well.
