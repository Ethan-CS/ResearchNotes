# 2P2N-SAT to CFire reduction

### Questions & thoughts:

Consider the $2P2N$-SAT problem, a variant of 3-SAT for which in a formula $\phi$, every variableÂ $x_i$ for $1\leq i \leq n, n\in \mathbb{N}$ occurs twice as a positive literal and twice as a negative literal. This is NP-complete - see [[202401261523 2P2N-SAT Complete]].

Instance of 2-2-SAT: variables $x_1, \dots, x_n$ and clauses $C_1, \dots, C_m$ in 3CNF composing a formula $\phi$. Question: is there a satisfying assignment of variables such that $\phi$ evaluates to true?
