# 2P2N-SAT to CFire reduction

### Questions & thoughts:

Consider the $2P2N$-SAT problem, a variant of 3-SAT for which in a formula $\phi$, every variableÂ $x_i$ for $1\leq i \leq n, n\in \mathbb{N}$ occurs twice as a positive literal and twice as a negative literal. This is NP-complete - see [[202401261523 2P2N-SAT Complete]].

Instance of 2-2-SAT: variables $x_1, \dots, x_n$ and clauses $C_1, \dots, C_m$ in 3CNF composing a formula $\phi$. Question: is there a satisfying assignment of variables such that $\phi$ evaluates to true?

Construct a graph $G$ as follows. Starting from a single vertex (the root) labelled $r$, create $2n$ paths from $r$, each of length $n+2m$. For each path $P_i$ for $1\leq i\leq n$, label the vertex of degree 1 $v_i^+$ and for $n+1\leq i \leq 2n$, label the vertex $v_i^-$. Then, for the terminal (leaf) vertex of each path, add two further vertices only adjacent to the leaf, label one $C_j$ and the other $C_k$, which indicate the clauses in which the literal appears ($j$ and $k$ need not be distinct). Now, let the budget $b$ be 2 and define a cost function over the vertices of $G$ as follows:
$$
c(v, t)=\begin{cases}
3 &\textrm{if } v \textrm{ is on a path}\\
2 &\textrm{if } v \textrm{ is the literal } x_i \textrm{ and } t=i\\
1 &\textrm{if }
\end{cases}
$$
