# What to do with feedback

**Previous note:** [[202410070918 Complex Networks Reviews]]

### Questions & thoughts:

**Question:** what do we do with feedback? This should be a rough outline of what we could do given some general feedback from students about GTAs in CS courses
#### Collection and processing

Informal feedback: 
 - During initial training, we could encourage GTAs to solicit feedback from students when and wherever appropriate.
 - This is particularly helpful earlier on, so that GTAs can adapt teaching to suit the needs of their groups.

Questionnaire feedback: 
 - Aim to send out some questionnaires to students (will keep this general until we know more about what questions will be asked, when and how).
 - When per-course formal feedback is gathered, first step is to anonymise.
 - Feedback may include information on lab/tutorial content, which is valuable to the course coordinator, but questions should try to focus on gathering information about delivery (there should/could be another more appropriate way to inform CCs about lab content, e.g. their own evaluations, as GTAs have little to no control over this)
 - Data for each GTA, anonymised to remove student names, should at least reach the GTA individually. This would ideally also go to the line manager, to support in the following.
	 - Tailored support for GTAs with identifiable weaknesses in evaluations, e.g. suggestion for more pedagogical training.
	 - In GTA training, we could spend some time showing GTAs how to interpret and act on student feedback - important we don't get GTAs catastrophising results
 - Feedback over all GTAs on a course could be further anonymised to remove link to each GTA before CC receives it, so they are given an impression of teaching overall and the GTA isn't in the position of having a PDR-like discussion for each course they teach. 
 - Anonymised/aggregated or not, this is valuable information for CCs, helping them understand likes/dislikes, problem areas and strengths of the lab/tutorial teaching and delivery
 - Same or further aggregated data are valuable to the department
	 - Common issues across courses?
	 - Effectiveness (and justification) of GTAs?
	 - Effectiveness of training, identifying needs for/justifying development of further training?

P2P Feedback:
 - Something the GTA working group suggested several years ago was organising some more senior tutors who would be willing to sit in on more junior tutors labs. 
 - This was something a reasonable number of both 'mentors' and 'mentees' in the GTA cohort expressed interest in at the time - primarily as a confidence boosting exercise for the mentee, also to gain some constructive criticism with a peer. 
 - More 'formal' feedback could be a standard form that the mentor fills out while observing and uses in discussion with the GTA and/or sends on to course coordinator/line manager.
