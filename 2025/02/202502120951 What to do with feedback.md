# What to do with feedback

### Questions & thoughts:

**Question:** what do we do with feedback? This should be a rough outline of what we could do given some general feedback from students about GTAs in CS courses
#### Collection and processing

*Informal feedback:* we could encourage GTAs to solicit feedback from students when and wherever appropriate. This is particularly helpful earlier on, so that GTAs can adapt teaching to suit the needs of their groups.

*Questionnaire feedback:* we aim to send out some questionnaires to students (will keep this general until we know more about what questions will be asked, when and how). The results of these questionnaires is the focus of this document.

Once per-course formal feedback is gathered, first step is to anonymise. Then, it can be shared with the course coordinator, helping them understand likes/dislikes, problem areas and strengths of the lab/tutorial teaching and delivery. This may include information on content, but questions should try to seek information about how this is delivered (there should/could be another more appropriate way to inform CCs about lab content, e.g. their own evaluations, as GTAs have little to no control over this). Anonymised data should at least reach the GTA individually, ideally it would also go to the line manager. The feedback over all GTAs on a course could be further anonymised to remove link to each GTA, so the course coordinator gets an impression of teaching overall and the GTA isn't in the position of having a PDR-like discussion for each course they teach.

*P2P Feedback:* something the GTA working group suggested several years ago was organising some more senior tutors who would be willing to sit in on more junior tutors labs. This was something a reasonable number of both 'mentors' and 'mentees' in the GTA cohort expressed interest in at the time - primarily as a confidence boosting exercise for the mentee, also to gain some constructive criticism with a peer. More 'formal' feedback could be a standard form that the mentor fills out while observing and uses in discussion with the GTA and/or sends on to course coordinator/line manager.
